Simulation
==========

Package to analyze simulations made with Gadget2 code of the UGent dwarf galaxies research group.

### Functions of possible general interest

* Surface brightness computation and color plot (`luminosity.py`).
* Conversion from Johson filters to SDSS and other band using conversion formulas (`magnitude_transformation.py`).
* Derived functions (`derived.py`).
* Computation of Neutral Fraction, CII emission from tabulated values by De Rijcke 2013 (`interp/`).
* HI mass-size relation computation and comparison with observations (`m_r_HI.py`).


If you find this code useful, for now please cite De Rijcke 2013.
